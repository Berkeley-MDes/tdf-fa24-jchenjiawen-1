# Week 1#
## What I did this week...
**1. Set up Ultimaker 3 and Form 3**\
The last time I used a 3d printer was 5+ years ago. So it's great to go through all the instructions again. Also, now the 3d printers are better and more materials are available.

**2. Check out Rhino and Grasshopper example files**\
I was a landscape architect, so I have been working with these two tools for half of my lifetime.

**3. 3D Print out something**\
I randomly chose to print an egg separator (and also very useful in the kitchen!). Because of the time, I downloaded a .stl file from the Internet and made the 3D printing file. The printing is still in progress, I will add images to this report if it finishes before 3 pm.

I found many websites have free 3d printing-ready models for downloading.\

## What I thought about this week...
A phone stand... That's a tiny thing, and there are more than many well-made products on the market. How can I be more innovative with a very limited time?

**Adding**
1. Phone stand + speaker?
2. Phone stand attaches to iPad, laptop, or monitor.
3. Phone stand + selfie taker.

**Minimizing**
1. Ultra thing and portable phone stand.
2. Foldable phone stand.
3. A magnetic phone stand to be stuck on surfaces. For example, street poles.

**Manifesto**
1. When people need a cell phone stand, their hands are occupied, but they need to look at the phone. What if my phone stand is ***NOT*** designed for people to ***look at the phone ALL THE TIME***? but to be away from the cell phone?

3. A bulky phone stand, and not portable at all.
4. A phone stand for ***PHONE***, instead of cell phones.

## Lessons learned...
1. The self serviced 3d printing(aka UberEats of 3D printing) is convenient, but not many machines are available! I haven't figured out how to queue yet... Probably it's not allowed. So next time leave at least 2 days for that.
2. Github markdown is not user-friendly. Adding an image and video is inhumane...
