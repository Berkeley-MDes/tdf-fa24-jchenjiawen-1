## What I did
### Sample file experiments
1. I read through the sample grasshopper file and drew a diagram of my understanding of how it works.

2. I tweaked some of the parameters. The major intention was to find the minimum size of the sample design that could still meet the manufacturing standard.

3. When it's too small, there is a gravity problem.
4. The smallest shape I found is as below.

### Using the sample file to generate a new design
1. I tried to take a look at the packaged GH script, but it's too complicated for me to understand. I will just use it as it is.\

2. I wanted to try out a polyhedron phone stand. So the first step is to build a basic shape.
3. I went with the Voronoi shape, which I was more familiar with from my previous architectural design experience.

4. I started with importing a cube from Rhino to quickly test my script. Once the script worked, I replaced the input cube with a short script that generates a cube in GH directly.\

5. Because Voronoi is random, most of the time the center of the generated polyhedron doesn't match with the center of the cell phone.

<img src="/Week2/2.jpg" width = "500"></img>

6. I added a move command. It's good enough for my little test.\
