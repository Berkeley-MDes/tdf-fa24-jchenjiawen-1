## What I did this week...
**1. Set up Ultimaker 3 and Form 3**
The last time I used a 3d printer was 5+ years ago. So it's great to go through all the instructions again. Also, now the 3d printers are better and more materials are available.

**2. Check out Rhino and Grasshopper example files**
I was a landscape architect, so I have been working with these two tools for half of my lifetime.


## What I thought about this week...
A phone stand... That's a tiny thing, how can I be more innovative with a very limited time?
**Adding**
1. Phone stand + speaker?
2. Phone stand attaches to iPad, laptop, or monitor.
3. Phone stand + selfie taker.

**Minimizing**
1. Ultra thing and portable phone stand.
2. A magnetic phone stand to be stuck on surfaces. For example, street poles.

**Manifesto**
1. When people need a phone stand, their hands are occupied, but they need to look at the phone. What if my phone stand is not designed for people to ***LOOK at the phone ALL THE TIME***? but to be away from the phone?
2. A bulky phone stand, and not portable at all.
3. A phone stand for ***PHONE***, instead of cell phones.
