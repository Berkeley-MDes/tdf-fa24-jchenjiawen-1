## What I did this week
### Design system
For assignment 1, I'm thinking of designing a system that helps every unique hand use a regular pen. It's a pen grip that transfers the dimension of the hand, including length, width, and gripping strength into Grasshopper parameters. Iâ€™d like to use 3d printing for prototyping and iteration.
I referenced an online tutorial when I encountered difficulty in making the triangular polyhedron.

### 3D printing
I 3d printed 3 times this week...
The first was supposed to be a draft model with PLA. However, the reference I used was in the wrong units. Therefore the printouts are huge and not usable at all.\

Then I scaled it to the right size and tried with another material - flexible resin. For my design, it would be good if the pen grip is somewhat elastic. I used the Form 3 printer in the Advanced Lab, and this is the first time I have worked with this kind of printer. But this attempt was not that successful either, because I put too many support materials on a tiny object.
Informed by these two attempts, the third one was successful. \

### Video making
I hope to tell a story with my video, so I started with why I have this idea and documented all of my efforts, including the failures.

## What I thought about this week
I wish I had more time for research. I believe parametric design, or computational design relies heavily on research works. How to define the criteria? How to transfer them into parametrics? But with a very limited time, I almost had to skip the research part and get straight into design/production. So the system includes a lot of guessing and eyeballing. I think my quick test is enough to show the idea, but a deeper understanding of the ergonomics of hands is required to make a practical design system.


## Speculation of next week
I will finalized the video and write the project report for this assignment.
